# SPEECH-TO-TEXT-AND-TEXT-TO-SPEECH-SYSTEM
Build a system that converts spoken language into written text (speech-to-text) and vice versa (text-to-speech) using advanced speech-processing algorithms

Certainly! Below is a sample README file for your speech processing system:

Speech Processing System
Overview
Welcome to the Speech Processing System! This system is designed to convert spoken language into written text (speech-to-text) and written text into spoken language (text-to-speech) using advanced speech processing algorithms. The system utilizes Java and incorporates features for user interaction through the command line.

Features
Speech-to-Text Conversion

Choose the option to convert spoken language to written text.
The system prompts the user to speak a sentence.
Utilizes advanced speech processing algorithms to convert spoken language into written text.
Text-to-Speech Conversion

Choose the option to convert written text to spoken language.
The system prompts the user to enter text.
Utilizes advanced text-to-speech algorithms to generate spoken language from the provided text.
User-Friendly Interface

Interactive command-line interface with clear instructions and options.
Robust error handling for invalid input.
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
A microphone for speech input (for speech-to-text conversion).
Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code

Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd speech-processing-system
Compile and run the Java program:

bash
Copy code
javac SpeechProcessingSystem.java
java SpeechProcessingSystem
Follow the on-screen instructions to choose the desired conversion option and provide the required input.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues with audio input or output, ensure that your microphone is properly connected and configured. Additionally, check your system's audio settings.
Dependencies
The system uses the standard Java libraries and does not require any external dependencies.
